WGU,WGU Acceleration Survey Results,"First off this: [https://gph.is/1EoZOyA](https://gph.is/1EoZOyA)

Sorry, I'm late my a few days, I got called out of town at the last minute. I may have made an error or two, but I spent about three days scrubbing this and it seems fairly stable.

These are the results of the WGU Acceleration Survey (First Pass). In this pass, I will focus on the numbers and summary of what was submitted. As context, these are the responses to the survey [request linked here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/cw9oxv/wgu_acceleration_survey/)

I will work on a textual analysis of the comments submitted and post that under a separate post (that may take a while).

The survey is closed and here are the results:

**TOTALS**:

|School|Number Responding|Bachelors|Masters|Percent of current enrollment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Business|297|246|51|0.75%|
|Information Technology|269|242|27|1.46%|
|Teaching|58|29|29|0.24%|
|Nursing|19|11|8|0.07%|

**Median Pace Reporting (half of the students reported faster, half reported slower):**

|Degree|Business|IT|Teaching|Nursing|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bachelors|23|23|23|22.8|
|Masters|23|11.5|22.8|19.1|

&gt;Because this is named an Acceleration Survey, it's likely that more Accelerators answered than non-accelerators. Also, if a Bachelor's Degree is 120 credits, the median time to complete for Accelerators is 5.2 terms, or just over 2.5 years.

Since we have such a small sample size for Teaching and Nursing, I will exclude those from the rest of the results.

In order to measure acceleration over the median, I will use the following scale:

1 = Median progress (23 credits per term for Bachelors)

2 = Double pace (46/term) up to 5 = Hyper Accelerators (115+ credits in a single term)

In this way, we can try to understand how each factor, on its own, contributes towards acceleration. For any statistics masters out there, yes it would be more useful to do an ANOVA for all variables, but as we know, the survey wasn't completely scientific, so such rigor is unlikely to show anything more than a simple analysis.

**Factor 1 - Credits Transferred in:**

|Credits|Business (Average/StDev)|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|None|1.9 / 1.4|2.3 / 1.5|
|1-15|1.7 / 1.3|1.5 / 1.1|
|16-30|1.6 / 0.9|1.7 / 1.3|
|31-60|1.6 / 1.1|1.5 / 0.9|
|More than 60|1.3 / 0.5|1.5 / 0.9|

&gt;This makes sense as students who transfer in more credits have fewer credits to complete and thus hyper-acceleration isn't a factor. It's also interesting that having at least some credits seems to help acceleration.

**Factor 2 - Prior Education:**

|Education|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|High School|1.9 / 1.6|1.6 / 1.1|
|Some College|1.7 / 1.1|1.8 / 1.3|
|Associates|1.5 / 1.0|1.5 / 0.8|
|Bachelor's|1.2 / 0.4|1.3 / 0.8|

&gt;Again, seems to make sense that more college means fewer credits to accelerate and at least for IT some college is better than no college.

**Factor 3 - Years away from college (r=0.8)**

|Years away|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|None|1.2 / 0.8|1.3 / 0.9|
|1-5|1.6 / 1.1|1.5 / 1.0|
|6-9|1.6 / 0.9|1.8 / 1.3|
|10+|1.8 / 1.2|1.8 / 1.2|

&gt;This looks interesting as it suggests that time away from education may have a positive impact on acceleration.

**Factor 4 - Years of Experience in your field (Bus r=0.6 / IT r=0.7)**

|Years of Experience|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|None|1.8 / 1.2|1.3 / 0.9|
|1-5|1.3 / 0.8|1.5 / 1.0|
|6-9|2.0 / 1.2|1.7 / 0.9|
|10+|1.7 / 1.2|1.9 / 1.3|

&gt;This suggests that lots of IT experience may help, but it's not nearly as clear of a benefit on the business side.

**Factor 5 - How smart do you think you are (Bus r=0.9 / IT r=0.5)**

|Smart|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Below Average|1.0 / 0.7|1.4 / 0.5|
|Average|1.5 / 1.1|1.5 / 1.0|
|Above Average|1.6 / 1.0|1.5 / 1.1|
|Extremely Smart|2.4 / 1.3|2.2 / 1.4|

&gt;About half of all surveyed answered above average. People who considered themselves exceptional did a bit better on acceleration.

**Factor 6 - How comfortable are you taking tests (Bus r=0.9 / IT r=0.6)**

|Comfort|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Panic|0.7 / 0.5|1.3 / 0.5|
|Uncomfortable|1.2 / 0.8|1.3 / 1.0|
|Average|1.5 / 1.1|1.3 / 0.5|
|Above Average|1.5 / 0.9|1.4 / 1.0|
|Exceptional|2.0 / 1.3|1.9 / 1.3|

&gt;This factor seems to be fairly important with those saying they are good test takers doing significantly better.

**Factor 7 - How comfortable are you reading complex topics (Bus r=0.8 / IT r=0.5)**

|Comfort|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Terrible|0.8 / 0.4|1.3 / 0.6|
|Uncomfortable|1.5 / 1.1|1.6 / 1.1|
|Average|1.4 / 0.8|1.3 / 0.7|
|Above Average|1.5 / 1.0|1.5 / 1.1|
|Exceptional|2.2 / 1.3|2.0 / 1.3|

&gt;This shows that only those who believe they are exceptional readers correlated with higher acceleration.

**Factor 8 - How well do you write (Bus r=0.2 / IT r=-0.2)**

|Writing|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Terrible|1.0 (only 1 reporting)|1.5 / 0.6|
|Poor|1.8 / 1.3|1.6 / 1.1|
|Average|1.4 / 1.0|1.6 / 1.0|
|Above Average|1.7 / 1.2|1.6 / 1.1|
|Exceptional|1.7 / 1.0|1.6 / 1.2|

&gt;Again, no clear determination that writing well will help you do accelerate.

**Factor 9 - Current Employment (Bus r=-0.8 / IT r=0.7)**

|Employment|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Unemployed|1.8 / 1.3|1.4 / 1.0|
|Part-Time|1.6 / 1.1|1.6 / 1.1|
|Full-Time|1.6 / 1.1|1.6 / 1.1|
|Overtime|1.7 / 1.0|1.3 / 0.8|

&gt;70-80% of respondents said they were full time employed. Work seems to hurt Business Students but help IT students accelerate

**Factor 10 - Family Obligations (Bus r=0.1 / IT r=0.8)**

This was hard as several options can be combined, So I ranked the burden into groups:

|Family Obligations|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0 - None|1.9 / 1.3|1.3 / 0.6|
|1 - Spouse/Companion Only|1.7 / 1.1|1.7 / 1.1|
|2 - Caregiver / Spouse+1 / Spouse+Exceptional|1.5 / 1.1|1.4 / 1.0|
|3 - Sole Parent / Sole Exceptional / Spouse+2|1.6 / 1.0|1.8 / 1.3|
|4 - Sole Parent 2+ / Spouse+2+Caregiver / Spouse+2+Exceptional|1.5 / 1.2|2.2 / 1.4|
|5 - Anything over 4|2.5 / 1.9|1.0 (only 1 reporting)|

&gt;For business, very little correlation on this one and I tried to sort it in different ways to find one. For IT it appears strongly correlated (more family = more acceleration)

**Factor 11 - Own study or workspace**

|Own Space|Business|IT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Yes|1.6 / 1.1|1.5 / 1.0|
|No|1.7 / 1.0|2.0 / 1.4|

&gt;75% reported having their own space, so this one is not strongly correlated.",0.99,199,0,199
WGU,I'm done. Finished all 109 credit hours.,"I finished in 1 month. This was only possible because :

1. I was sick and lost my job months ago, finally got better and realized I had the time &amp; ability to get a degree. I wanted to do it as fast as possible because I desperately need health insurance (I have a severe medical issue that requires annual testing)
2. I had 10-16 hours a day dedicated to school
3. I knew a good amount already, especially in the business classes (more than I thought initially.)
4. I am a better than average test taker.
5. I like to read.

Even with that I thought this would take me Minimum 3 months, Did it in 1. I am shocked. I did not think this was possible.

Do NOT feel bad if you are going at a slow pace. I did not have a life outside of school for that entire month. My average phone usage was 22 min a day.  My brain is fried. If I had to work full time this would have taken me 10x longer. If I had a family to take care of, even longer.

I am very happy with my accomplishment though.  Hope to get a good job with benefits.

WGU,What do you all think of the updates to the SAP?,"I got this email today regarding changes to the SAP. this is what it says.

Policy Updates
 
To provide additional clarity and continuously improve the student experience, the Academic Progress and Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policies have been updated effective for terms beginning on or after July 1, 2023.

The Academic Progress student handbook policy includes the following updates:
In lieu of a minimum credit unit (CU) requirement based on the program level, all students, regardless of program level, must now complete at least 1 CU.
Administrative withdrawal due to lack of academic progress is now conditional on student failure to complete at least 1 CU in two consecutive terms rather than a single term.
The academic suspension period was shortened from 6 to 3 months.
The Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) student handbook policy includes the following updates:
SAP requirements will be the same for all terms.
Students that do not complete courses in a single term and have not achieved a 66.67% SAP standing will have a warning term, allowing them to get back in good standing by the end of their next term.
Please continue to discuss your academic progress with your Program Mentor regularly to ensure you meet these policies. Thank you for continuing to choose WGU for your educational endeavors.


Sincerely,

WGU,Am I an idiot?,"Imma branch manager of a bank. Earlier this year I graduated with a bachelors degree in business administration IT management. This degree was essentially free because I recycled tuition reimbursement from my job the whole way. I chose IT management because I made it halfway through a data analytics degree and wanted to pivot, and that was the quickest path to a degree. Instead of getting a masters degree, I chose to go for the bachelors in finance program that WGU recently launch. I chose this because I didn‚Äôt see myself getting into IT, I already managed a bank, and I was very close to being done. I started the term at 80% complete with about 11 classes to go. This go around I had to take out student loans. Now that I‚Äôm almost done, I‚Äôm regretting not continuing to pursue an IT career (I did get an A+ cert in my first).

WGU,Version Control D197 Tips,"This course isn't that bad to begin with. You should download Git and VS Code before you start doing anything else. It might confusing at first, but take your time to learn it if you don't already know how to use it. Really it should only take 1 day for you to do it as long as you understand it and not be confused by the instructions. There's several great sources I'll provide to you because they're very helpful and simplistic in regards to using Git. You'll be using Git, Gitlab, and VS Code for modifying files on there. I watched several different videos that should help you out and I will include a Git command cheatsheet in the links below as well because it'll help you do version control better by not having to memorize every command. There's also a reddit post I'll link below as well. I didn't use any of the learning resources they provided to you for learning Git/Version Control. Take a look at the videos because it'll help you out big time.

This is the reddit post that explains everything in greater detail on what you should be doing. It should hopefully simplify the instructions for you, so you understand how to finish this course. At first, I experienced confusion and it made me take longer than normal. I took 2 days to complete this version control assessment.

WGU,Just passed Business of IT - Project Management - C176 (Project+),"This was a rough one.  

The CompTIA course material provided in the C176 course materials is good for studying. I found nothing better.  
Normally the CompTIA materials suck badly, so I ignored them. Finally,finding nothing decent, I tried them.  
Not horrible. A first. Read the material, and use the chapter tests, PBQ, and labs.  
Ignore the practice exams till the end. They are tough- tougher than the real test. Don't take them too soon, they will discourage.

Go get the Wiley book in the WGU library and use it to sign up for their practice exams. Use these practice exams to test progress and see where you need to focus your study.
